# Isolating the Telescope/Snacks Crash Cause

Since the crash still occurs even without preview, something else is triggering when selecting files. Here's a systematic approach to find the culprit.

## Potential Causes

When you navigate to a file in telescope (even without selecting it), these things can happen:

1. **Buffer Creation** - A scratch buffer might be created
2. **Filetype Detection** - Vim tries to determine the file type
3. **Autocommands** - Various plugins register autocommands that fire
4. **LSP Attachment** - Language servers might try to attach
5. **Git Operations** - Gitsigns or other git plugins might check status
6. **Syntax/Indent Loading** - Even without treesitter, vim might load syntax files
7. **Plugin Integrations** - Various plugins hook into file operations

## Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Test with Minimal Config
Run in the problematic directory:
```bash
cd ~/nixos-config
nvim -u /home/cipher/Repositories/cipher-nixvim/debug-telescope-selection.lua
:TestTelescope
# Search for "xmon" and check /tmp/telescope-debug.log
```

### Step 2: Binary Search Plugins
Add to your config temporarily:
```nix
imports = [
  ./find-culprit-plugin.nix
  # ... rest of config
];
```

Then test with different modes by editing `find-culprit-plugin.nix`:
- `testMode = "baseline"` - Disables most plugins
- `testMode = "disable-lsp"` - Disables LSP features
- `testMode = "disable-git"` - Disables git integration
- `testMode = "disable-ui"` - Disables UI enhancements
- `testMode = "disable-treesitter"` - Disables treesitter completely

### Step 3: Check Specific Triggers

#### Test if it's filetype detection:
```vim
:set eventignore=FileType
:Telescope find_files
```

#### Test if it's buffer creation:
```vim
:set eventignore=BufAdd,BufNew,BufEnter,BufRead
:Telescope find_files
```

#### Test if it's syntax loading:
```vim
:syntax off
:Telescope find_files
```

### Step 4: Strace Analysis
If nothing above helps, trace system calls:
```bash
strace -o /tmp/nvim-strace.log -f nvim
# Try to reproduce crash
# Check the end of /tmp/nvim-strace.log
```

## Quick Workarounds While Debugging

### Option 1: Use a different picker
```bash
# Install and use fzf
nix-shell -p fzf fd
fd . | fzf
```

### Option 2: Disable Telescope completely for this repo
```vim
" In ~/nixos-config/.nvimrc or .exrc
if getcwd() =~ 'nixos-config'
  nnoremap <leader><leader> :e **/*
endif
```

### Option 3: Use vim's built-in
```vim
:find **/xmon<Tab>
```

## Most Likely Culprits

Based on the symptoms (crashes only in specific repo with "xmon" pattern):

1. **LSP trying to attach** - Check if any LSP is configured for Haskell
2. **Git integration** - The repo might have corrupted git objects
3. **File permissions** - Check `ls -la users/xmonad/xmonad.hs`
4. **Autocommands** - Some plugin might have a badly written autocommand
5. **Memory issue** - The specific file might trigger a memory leak

## Next Steps

1. Run the minimal debug script to see what happens before crash
2. Use the plugin isolation config to narrow down the culprit
3. Check system logs: `sudo dmesg | tail -50` after crash
4. Report findings so we can create a targeted fix
